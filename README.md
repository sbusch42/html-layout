# HTML/CSS layout template

This project contains layout templates for typical website layouts, which are surprisingly difficult to achieve with standard HTML/CSS means. They are implemented in plain HTML/CSS, using modern CSS flexbox layout.

The layouts are single-page, horizontal-split, vertical-split, as well as full pages with multiple top and side bars. Sidebars and main content panes can scroll independently of each other.

These templates do not require javascript and do not use or depend on any external libraries or frameworks, such as jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, React, etc. But they can easily be integrated as templates into any of these frameworks and be used in their context.
